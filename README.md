# Automatic Solar Tracker 

**ELEC4020** - **Embedded System** <br>
Final Project: Automatic Solar Tracker

Group 10:
- Tran Huy Hoang Anh 
- Chu Ha Linh
- Anh Quan Pham  

Pins Assignments:
- ADC pins: PE1 - PE2 and PE3 - PE4
- PWM output: 
    - PF2: controls motor 0 based on signals received from the LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) connected to PE1 and PE2.
    - PF3: controls motor 1 based on signals received from the LDR connected to PE3 and PE4.

Create your own setup by modifying config variables in [control_motor.c](control_motor.c) and [read_sensors.c](read_sensors.c)
